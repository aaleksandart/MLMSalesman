# MLMSalesman

MLMSalesman is a console application that starts with a grid of houses and one salesman.
The size of the grid and the amount of times to repeat the process is decided by the user.
Every house starts with one unemployed person. The salesman then walks in random direction and converts unemployed people one by one. When all people on the grid are salesmen, we display the average time it took to convert all.
